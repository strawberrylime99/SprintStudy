If your class is only 8 weeks long, every missed day compounds fast.

## Weekly planning sequence

1. List every graded item for the full term.
2. Mark each due date by week number.
3. Assign one primary deliverable per weekday.
4. Reserve one catch-up block every Saturday.

## Keep your grade target realistic

Instead of tracking only current grade, track the minimum score needed on the next assignment to stay on target.
This keeps decisions concrete when time gets tight.

## SprintStudy shortcut

Use the [SprintStudy bundle](/templates/sprintstudy) to set this up once, then repeat weekly.
