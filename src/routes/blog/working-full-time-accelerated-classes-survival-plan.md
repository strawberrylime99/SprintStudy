Most working students fail from planning overload, not effort.

## The 3-block model

- Block A: 45-60 minutes after work for reading or discussion posts.
- Block B: 90 minutes for assignment drafting.
- Block C: 2-3 hours on weekend for revision and submission.

## Protect one emergency slot

Every week, leave one unassigned slot for surprises.
If unused, convert it to review time.

## Build once, reuse weekly

The [SprintStudy template kit](/templates/sprintstudy) includes prebuilt weekly blocks and assignment tracking so you can focus on execution.
