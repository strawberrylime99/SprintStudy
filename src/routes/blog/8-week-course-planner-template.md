8 week course planner is easier when your planning system is simple and repeatable.
This guide focuses on fast implementation for students in accelerated terms.

## 8 week course planner: fast rules

- Plan by week, not by motivation.
- Track each assignment in one place.
- Protect one catch-up block every week.

## Why accelerated classes feel hard

In short terms, one missed deadline can affect multiple upcoming weeks.
A clear weekly plan gives you earlier decisions and less panic.

## Weekly implementation steps

1. List all deliverables due in the next 14 days.
2. Assign each deliverable to one specific study block.
3. Leave one overflow block open.
4. Review progress every Sunday in 10 minutes.

## Common mistakes to avoid

- Building a new planning system every week.
- Tracking grades without next-assignment targets.
- Ignoring buffer time for unexpected schedule changes.
